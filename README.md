# Machine-Learning-Coursera
This is my solution to the programming assignments of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. In the course Andrew Ng uses the Octave program, but I chose to use python to write the code. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.
